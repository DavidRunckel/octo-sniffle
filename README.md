IMPORTANT NOTE: This project was from my CS1302 course so while all the code regarding making the application function is my intellectual property, the concept was derived from instructiion provided by Dr. Barnes (Bradley J. Barnes) and Dr. Cotterell (Michael E. Cotterell).

This project under the code name "octo-sniffle" is the presentation of my knowledge regarding queues made through linked lists, generics, inheritance. Each linked urgency queue has a variety of methods that execute different commands clearly outlined by their names and the comments above each method. The true goal of the project was to showcase that due to inheritance, the classes LinkedUrgencyQueue and CustomLinkedUrgencyQueue could use methods within BaseLinkedUrgencyQueue.

The primary portion of the code reflecting the knowledge I learned in class and applied to the project is contained in the 3 UrgencyQueue's while the Tester file was primarily utilized to showcase everything ran successfully. When you run the project, the tester file is the one ran but the code can be edited to comment out portions you'd like to test due to my thorough testing offering an abundance of methods that can be ran to showcase each command be it dequeue, enqueue, filter, etc..
